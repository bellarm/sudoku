# sudoku

Hello world!

My name is Bella Mangunsong, and I am a computer science student at The University of New South Wales. I started this sudoku solver project for one of my computing subjects.

I will provide the test files for my sudoku program and instruction on how to use it.
Right now, my program can only deal with very easy puzzles due to the limitations of the algorithms being used
