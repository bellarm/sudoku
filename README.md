# sudoku

Hello world!

My name is Bella Mangunsong, and I am a computer science student at The University of New South Wales. I started this sudoku solver project for one of my computing subjects.

Right now, my program can only deal with very easy puzzles due to the limitations of the algorithms being used.

Instruction:

Compile the program using this command:
gcc -Wall -Werror -O -o sudoku sudoku.c

If you have downloaded my test cases run it by typing:
./sudoku < test1.txt
(make sure they are in the same directory)

If you want to try using your own puzzle, run the program by typing ./sudoku and enter your puzzle in this format:
010200304
700004018
640103500
057800460
004051002
820306750
403905280
506080007
000607940
