# sudoku
Hello world!

My name is Bella Mangunsong, and I am a computer science student at The University of New South Wales. I started this sudoku solver project for one of my computing subjects. At this point, I'm pretty sure this will solve any sudoku puzzle. Let me know if this could not solve your puzzle! :)

Instruction:

Compile the program using this command:

gcc -Wall -Werror -O -o sudoku sudoku.c

If you have downloaded my test cases run it by typing:

./sudoku < test1.txt

(make sure they are in the same directory)

If you want to try using your own puzzle, run the program by typing ./sudoku and enter your puzzle in this format:

010200304

700004018

640103500

057800460

004051002

820306750
